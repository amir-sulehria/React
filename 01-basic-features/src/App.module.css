/*2.4
to change in-line style dynamically and assign className dynamically see
button style in App.js
the problem we're currenlty facing is we can't apply hover effect in inline style and if we do it in css 
file it will take place globally, let's first have a look at solution for applying hover on inline style,
we'll use a 3rd package library for this task as it's not possible in normal inline, for usage of
radium go to 2.5
*/


/*2.7
css modules let u use same css class name in different files without worrying about name clashes
they'll be used only where they r imported i.e local scope, now to use css module remove all traces of 
radium since we're not using it anymore, since we're using react-script 2+ so we only need to create file
as [name].module.css, at end the name of applied class will look like [filename]\_[classname]\_\_[hash],
when importing we get a js object which we can use to apply css, now lets remove inline styling and also
lets start using hover effect, below is normal rule to add style to btn that has red class and vice versa
for media queries see 2.8

now lets split the application that we copied into more componenets. Question is what should go into its
own componenet and do u group together in a higher componenet e.g. root component. If we analyze we'll
notice that person component is pretty focused, it display cards of one person and handles a click on
that card, leave person component as it is. however app component can be split up, there is a lot in 
render method like lists and in return statement we have btn handler, generally container componenet 
involve with state management should'nt be involved with ui rendering too much i.e. there render method
should be clean and contanin min jsx.
we'll make a persons component for list handling, also we can add cockpit component to include everything 
between divs in return statement


react provide many component lifecyle methods available only in stateful component, however not all these
methods are executed on creation, only below one execute on component creation
constructor(), componentWillMount(), componentDidMount(), render()

lets have a look at creation component lifecyle process, 
first of all constructor gets executed, 
if u want to implement constructor u also have to call super(props)

componentWillMount() will execute on 2nd no. , this method is defined by react and it's available because
we extended Component. It's not used oftenly. if u use it u'll use it to update ur state, do some
optimization. u should'nt reach out to web.

render() method execute on 3rd no. , now executing render doesn't mean it accesses real dom, it gives 
react idea of what it should render and how it should look like if it reaches to real dom.
child components are rendered.

componentDidMount() is executed at end. u can reac web but u shuoldn't update state.

we already have one statefull component but to see how child components gets re render 
we need to convert stateless components to statefull, process is simple
though one important this is to add this in front of props

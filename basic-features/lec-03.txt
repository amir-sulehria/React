Workflow
Why we need a complex work flow?
1-We want to optimize code, we want to ship code as small as possible
2-We want to use next gen js features
3-We want to be more productive(css auto prefixing(a thing to support a broader browser suppot for css features))
How we achieve such work flow?
1-use depedency management tools (dependencies are simply 3rd part libraries. e.g react, react dom etc) like npm
2-we also need a bundler, because we want to write modular code and split it up to multiple files, so each file is a 
clear task(focus) and therfore it's easier for us to manage, we also want to bundle this code into couple of files
in the end when shipping because some browsers don't support split up files. we'll use webpack as bundler. Webpack also 
allow us to apply some steps before bundling. e.g the mentioned compilation of next gen js features that requires 
another tool babel that does this compilation etc.
3-we want a development server and npm provide that.

Folder Structure
ignore lock files as they are locking dependencies which we're using
node modules contain all dependencies and sub dependencies of our project
public is root folder which get serve by web server, it include a index.html, we'll not use more than one
html files unless building multipage application
script files are added in src folder 
manifest.json here we can define some meta data about our application
